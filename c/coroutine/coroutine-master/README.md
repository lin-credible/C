It's an asymmetric coroutine library (like lua).

You can use coroutine_open to open a schedule first, and then create coroutine in that schedule. 

You should call coroutine_resume in the thread that you call coroutine_open, and you can't call it in a coroutine in the same schedule.

Coroutines in the same schedule share the stack , so you can create many coroutines without worry about memory.

But switching context will copy the stack the coroutine used.

```
main start
coroutine 0 : 0
coroutine 1 : 100
coroutine 0 : 1
coroutine 1 : 101
coroutine 0 : 2
coroutine 1 : 102
coroutine 0 : 3
coroutine 1 : 103
coroutine 0 : 4
coroutine 1 : 104
main end
```
